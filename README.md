## **Product Description**
Wakuwaku is an innovative Apple Watch app designed to bring excitement and wellness to daily life. Inspired by the Japanese term "Wakuwaku," meaning anticipation and joy, the app delivers personalized health tips in three key categories:
- **Stress & Anxiety**
- **Sports & Sleep**
- **Nutrition**

With a minimalist interface, customizable themes, and timely daily notifications, Wakuwaku ensures users stay engaged and motivated without feeling overwhelmed. Built using **Swift**, **SwiftUI**, and **WatchKit**, the app leverages the unique strengths of watchOS to provide an accessible, seamless, and enjoyable health management experienceâ€”right on your wrist.

   Clone or download the repository from GitHub by running the following command in your terminal:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/laixinran/wakuwaku_MCIThackathon.git

2. **Open in Xcode**:
  Open the downloaded project in Xcode.
  Ensure you have the latest versions of iOS and watchOS simulators installed.

3. **Build and Test**:

*The notification push feature currently requires a $99 Apple Developer Program enrollment fee for testing, which we have opted not to purchase for this demo version. Therefore, the Notification functionality is implemented in separate files: Notification.swift and main.swift.
